# Dodger
Dodger is a game where the player controls an object or character to sue obvious circumstances and earn points. If the player fails to avoid the object, the game ends and the end counter is displayed in the console. After certain points, the speed of the objects that need to be avoided increases, making it difficult to choose more points.
