# Reversi (Otello)
Reversi (original title: Othello) is a board game for two players that was invented by the Englishmen Lewis Waterman and John W. Mollet around 1880.

The game is played on an 8x8 board. The game is played with special two-color disks, one side of which is painted black and the other is white.

The game ends when the players have no possible moves left. At the end of the game, the disks of each color are counted, and the player with the most disks on the board is declared the winner. If at the end of the game there are an equal number of white and black disks on the board, the game ends in a draw.
